# Ng Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game built with Angular. It uses RxJS to handle the game logic and state management. The game is implemented using a reactive programming approach,
where the state of the game is managed using RxJS observables. The RxJS logics and patterns might not be perfect! I've built this just to learn more about RxJS and reactive programming and to have fun with it.
Any suggestions or improvements are welcome!
